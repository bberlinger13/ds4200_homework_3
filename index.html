            <h2>About Me and My Greenhouse</h2>
            <p> Hi! My name is Blythe, and I am a third-year student studying Data Science and Finance at Northeastern University. 
                I’ve always had a passion for gardening, and my greenhouse is where I spend a lot of my free time. 
                My dad and I worked on fixing up the greenhouse about 7 years ago, transforming it into a space where we can 
                nurture a variety of plants year-round. It has become one of our favorite spots to experiment with new plants, grow 
                seasonal favorites, and learn about the unique care each plant requires.

                Over the years, I've expanded my collection to include succulents, cacti, and some rare species that thrive in this 
                environment. The greenhouse also allows me to experiment with different gardening techniques, from optimizing watering 
                schedules to using organic fertilizers and testing various soil mixtures. Gardening has taught me patience, 
                attention to detail, and the importance of creating the right conditions for growth, whether it's plants or any other 
                aspect of life.
                
                In this space, I’ll introduce you to some of my favorite plants, explain how I care for them, and share some of the 
                lessons I’ve learned from working in the greenhouse. I hope to inspire others who are passionate about gardening and 
                encourage anyone interested in plants to give it a try! </p>
