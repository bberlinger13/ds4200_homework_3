            <h2>My Favorite Plants</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the details section of my greenhouse journey, where I’ll introduce some of my favorite plants and share how I care for them. Over the years, I’ve experimented with a variety of species, each with its own unique needs. One of the most stunning plants in my collection is the <strong>Agave Victoriae-Reginae</strong>, also known as Queen Victoria Agave. This succulent is known for its symmetrical rosette of thick leaves with striking white markings, and it requires minimal watering, making it a perfect low-maintenance plant. I water it sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings.</p>
            
            <p>The <strong>Golden Barrel Cactus</strong> is another favorite. Its spherical shape and golden-yellow spines make it a standout in my greenhouse. This cactus loves sunlight and thrives with only occasional watering. I’ve found that too much water can be harmful, so I keep its care routine simple.</p>

            <p>My <strong>Agave Americana</strong> and <strong>Agave Marginata</strong> are the giants of the greenhouse, each known for their large, pointed leaves. These plants love warmth and sunlight, but I’ve learned to keep their roots dry to prevent rot.</p>

            <p>Finally, my <strong>Jade Plant (Crassula ovata)</strong> has been one of the easiest to care for. Its thick, fleshy leaves store water, allowing it to thrive even when I forget to water it occasionally.</p>
