# Blythe's Greenhouse Plant Website

## Description
For my DS4200 Homework #5, I wanted to design a personal website about my greenhouse and the plants I grow. The site introduces my favorite plants and details the ways I care for them, including some of the unique species I've cultivated over the years. It showcases both my love for gardening and web development skills.
